# keshi – LIMBO

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I just been goin' through
motions
Back and forth like a ocean
I am a fraud, I am the shit
Hoping that nobody notice
Bang chest in the morning
Head down in the night
Drink less if I wanted
Strike up with the light
And square up, I'm the mightiest
Myself in the fight
Hurt twice but I tried it
No advice for this shit
Might die for this shit
Do I feel alive, feel alive,
feel alive?
Feel more like limbo
Hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset
That's more my tempo
Yeah, that's more my tempo
Ooh
But this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me
The best of me
Looked in my demons
and saw myself
Put all my meaning
in someone else
Outta sight, outta mind
Don't know where to find it
Don't know where to hide
But I still
Eat good, drink good,
feel good, s'all good
Can't hear my head
when I'm sat beside ya
Fucked lungs and a liver
Good looks in the mirror
Do I feel alive, feel alive,
feel alive?
Feel more like limbo
Hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset
That's more my tempo
That's more my tempo
Ooh
But this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me
The best of me
Ooh
Tryin' but I'm just a man
Hopin' it won't get
the best of me
The best of me
